  Browser extension that allows you to easily copy the URL of the Twitter post you're viewing with the added "vx" prefix. Using vxtwitter gives you better Twitter embeds on Discord, and this extension saves you the time of manually editing URLs every time you send them.

<h2>Installation</h1>
<div>
  Currently these extensions need to be installed manually, if there is interest I can submit them to the Chrome store though. I don't know if they work on Firefox, they were made for Chromium browsers. To install, head to "chrome:extensions" (or "whatever-browser-you-use:extensions") and enable developer mode at the top right of the screen. Download and unpack one or both of the extensions from the releases tab. Place the unpacked folder somewhere it won't be deleted. Go back to chrome:extensions and click "Load unpacked" at the top. Navigate to the folder you unpacked and install it.
