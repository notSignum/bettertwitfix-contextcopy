You have to install it manually if you want to use it. To do this, download the files from the repo, and put them in a folder somewhere. In your browser, go to chrome:extensions (or whatever-browser-you-use:extensions) and enable developer mode at the top right. Click "Load unpacked". Navigate to wherever you put the folder and install it.
